# PCB-Chip-Reader

Welcome! This is a Coco Darknet weights based YOLOv3 model trained to detect 
strings of letters and numbers on PCBs. 

To run, paste your images into the "images" folder, then run the script "main.py" in 
the "scripts" folder. Our code will then automatically use the YOLOv3 model to detect
IDs on your images. It will generate a CSV file of the strings it finds. This will
allow you to quickly identify what chips your PCBs contain.

Special thanks to the below blog post for its advice on the YOLOv3 model.
